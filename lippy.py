# parser combinator library Lippy.
"""
Lippy is a parser combinator library for Python 3.9+.
it's intentions are to help me parse out a custom programing language, but is a useful tool on its own.
Once complete will have a fully functional, declarative approach to parsing,
hopefully in a way that resembles the grammars themselves, so its super simple to use.
